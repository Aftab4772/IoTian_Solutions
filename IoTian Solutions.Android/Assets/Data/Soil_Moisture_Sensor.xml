			This is an easy to use digital soil moisture sensor. Just insert the sensor in the soil and it can can measure moisture or water level content in it. It gives a digital output of 5V when moisture level is high and 0V when the moisture level is low in the soil.

			The sensor includes a potentiometer to set the desired moisture threshold. When the sensor measures more moisture than the set threshold, the digital output goes high and an LED indicates the output. When the moisture in the soil is less thatn the set threshold, the output remains low. The digital output can be connected to a micro controller to sense the moisture level. The sensor also outputs an analog output which can be connected to the ADC of a micro controller to get the exact moisture level in the soild.

			This sensor is great for making water gardening projects, water sensing, etc.

			AO: analog output interface


			Connections:-

			VCC  connect to 3.3V-5V
			GND  connect to GND
			DO   digital value output connector（0 or 1）
			AO  analog value output connector



			Usage:-

			Soil moisture module is most sensitive to the ambient, generally used to detect the moisture content of the soil.
			When the module can not reach the threshold value, DO port output high, when the the soil humidity exceeds a set threshold value, the module D0 output low;
			The small board digital output D0 can be connected directly to the MCU, MCU to detect high and low, to detect soil moisture;
			Small board digital output DO can directly drive the buzzer module or relay module in our store, which can form a soil moisture alarm equipment;
			Small board analog output AO and AD module connected through the AD converter, you can get more precise values ​​of soil moisture;
