			BMP180 Sensor is an extremely precise low cost sensor from Bosch for measuring barometric pressure and temperature. Because pressure changes with altitude you can also use it as an altimeter! The sensor is soldered onto a PCB with a 3.3V regulator, I2C level shifter and pull-up resistors on the I2C pins. It is completely identical to the BMP085 in terms of firmware/software.
